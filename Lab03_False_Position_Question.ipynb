    "# **Lab 2 : False Position and Secant method**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The False Position method is one of the methods of finding roots of a non-linear function. Similar to the Bisection method, it falls under the category of **Bracketing methods** since the initial boundary guesses, x<sub>l</sub> and x<sub>u</sub>, must bracket the actual root. And the assumption here is that the function is real continuous, otherwise the False position method wouldn't work. The main difference between the Bisection method and False position method is that it takes advantage of the fact that one of the boundary values, either x<sub>l</sub> or x<sub>u</sub>, would have their functional value be closer to the zero of the function, and this would result in the new estimation x<sub>r</sub> be closer to one of the bracketing values than the mid-point x<sub>m</sub>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, we will be implementing the False position method in python. Just like in the previous lab for Bisection method, we will be considering the function f(x) as an array of coefficients, for instance if we want to have f(x) = x<sup>3</sup>+x-2, then in python we will create an array as follows:\n"
